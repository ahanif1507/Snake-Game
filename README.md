# Snake-Game

This is a two-player game. Each player controls a snake and attempts to
perform maneuvers so that it eats as many pellets as possible. Whoever eats
more pellets is the winner.

The snakes are controlled via keyboard commands. Snakes initially move
eastward, but at any moment a user can command the snake to stop moving or
else change directions (north, south, east, or west). The keyboard commands
for each player are as follows:

Player one (blue): w=north, s=south, d=east, a=west, q=pause

Player two (red): i=north, k=south, l=east, j=west, p=pause
